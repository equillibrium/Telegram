# Sent-TLGMessage How-to-use
This script lets you send a message using Telegram - fast, cool and secure messenger.
You can use it to send a message when a script is finished, when your SCCM OSD Task Sequence ended or encountered an error, when there's a new application version found (i.e. by you other site-crawling script) - pretty much any notification can be done using this tool.
How to use it:
1. Install Telegram and register an account.
2. Get yourself a Telegram bot using @BotFather inside Telegram
3. Get your Bot API token from @BotFather
4. Create a goup or channel or use existing chats to get your messages.
5. Get you chat, group or channel ID using [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20group%2C%20click,dummy%20message%20to%20the%20bot.&text=4%2D%20Look%20for%20%22chat%22,(with%20the%20negative%20sign))
